            <p class="eastBayP">I like this college because one of my family members alreafy graducate from their and they reccommened it. One advantage is that it is very close to home which will mean I can stay home with my parents. One of the majors i am instrested is
                in Compter Science </p>

            <p class="UOP">I like this college because it is way more different than here in California. There they get snow and it is more quiet than here. UO is also far away from home which makes me more indepedent to do things on my own without no one reminding
                me. Some of the majors that I am intrested that this college offers is Artchiture and Art & Technology.

                <p class="losAngelesP">I like this college because I have always had a Los Angeles dream. Also it is very close to San Monica and I heard it has a really nice beach. One advantage is that it is not far away from home. Easly get a plane to San Fransico and I
                    will be home in about an hour.</p>
